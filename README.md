# Snake Game

### We are *Game Jam Team 6*

In this project you’re going to build the classic game **“Snake”** using JavaScript, HTML & CSS.

In **Snake**, the player pilots a snake around a grid, trying to eat apples and avoid crashing into walls or their own tail. Each time the snake eats an apple, its body gets longer. Eventually it eats so many apples and its body gets so long that it fills up the entire world. Death becomes inescapable, and the player is suffocated beneath their own success and greed.
